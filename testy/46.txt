You write to say that life is just an old gift from God to lead us to unknown Yet I believe that we are here to prove that the road we're taking is the one So give it a moment Give it some time to lead you through Give it a sign to make you more than you can do So give it a feeling Give it some irony and joy Give it some fame for kind of things you do for love How long you think it takes to reach your heaven for peace, benignity of time Well I believe that we are here to know that for sure there's somewhere else to find So give it a moment Give it some time to lead you through Give it a sign to make you more than you can do So give it a feeling Give it some irony and joy Give it some fame for kind of things you do for love Give it a moment So give it a feeling For love For love Kind of things you do For love
