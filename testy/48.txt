Your dreams are where I talk to you The rose you grow, the moon The smoke you share for two and me Your dreams are in the way of where you're cold On New Year's Eve till dawn On August nights so hot And springs we miss a lot So when the dreams can finally come Can make our days so bright And stop your lonely tears, your tears So if there's no more tear to save for you The clock is weary too The day has gone too soon And no one's here for you, for good Goodnight love, goodnight love Dreams are dancing still in your head Try to keep them warm, make them stay Goodnight love, goodnight love Barely feel the heat at my door Windows closed, the days passed, they're gone We die [scatting] Your dreams are where you meet with mr Queen Tequila's mixed with gin After a three day spleen Your sun is history Dobranoc, dobranoc [scatting] Goodnight love, goodnight love Barely feel the heat at my door Windows closed, the days passed, they're gone Dobranoc, dobranoc [scatting] Goodnight love, goodnight love Barely feel the heat at my door Windows closed, the days passed, they're gone Dobranoc One day I'll fly, I'll fly away
